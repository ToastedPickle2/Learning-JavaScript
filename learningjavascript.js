//7 Primitive Data Types
/*
1. Number: Floating point numbers - Used for decimals and integers
2. String: Sequence of characters - Used for text
3. Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false - Used for taking decisions
4. Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')
5. Null: Also means 'empty value'
6. Symbol: Value that is unique and cannot be changed
7. BigInt: Larger integers than the Number data type can hold
